# Kilovolt Blog: Now With Node!

**Author**: Keli
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
An example of how a blog might be coded moving from a front-end only approach to a distributed system. Created as an assignment for Alchemy Code Lab's Bootcamp II.

## Getting Started
Currently, the blog can be viewed by cloning to your own machine and opening the HTML files in a browswer (ideally, Chrome).

## Architecture
The blog uses HTML, CSS, and JS along with jQuery and Handlebars. For this stage, we've added Node & Express.

## Change Log
See commit history.

## Credits and Collaborations
Starter code from Code Fellows.
